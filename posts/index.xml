&lt;p&gt;For years, I&amp;rsquo;ve been a devotee of virtualization, bouncing between bare metal, QEMU, and everything in between. Recent success with Proxmox has truly unlocked a level of performance and convenience I hadn’t thought possible. This post details my journey to building a robust, virtualized environment centered around Proxmox, and the lessons I learned along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="the-qemu-struggle-a-foundation-of-pain"&gt;The QEMU Struggle: A Foundation of Pain&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My initial foray into GPU passthrough started with QEMU. After months of troubleshooting, compiling kernels from source, and battling secure boot, I achieved near-native benchmarks (and in some benchmarks, I even &lt;em&gt;out-performed&lt;/em&gt; bare metal!), but stability proved elusive. The GPU would bind and unbind, but at some point a full system reboot was often required. While I achieved respectable performance, it felt like magic, not a repeatable solution.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
