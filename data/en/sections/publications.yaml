    paper:
      summary: One of the most expensive parts of underwater robotics is the sensors. This paper looks at modifying off the shelf components to create a sensor suite on a small budget. A big saving is made with sonar using a cheap commercial product to create a four sonar array. A depth sensor and acceleration navigation system are also developed.
